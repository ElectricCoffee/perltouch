Creates a new instance of the FilePrep class.
=over 4
=item B<file_name>
The file name of the file that is going to be generated.
=item B<file_ext> (optional)
The extension of the file to be generated.

The copyright year.
Leaving it out will default to the current year.

=item B<basename()>
Returns the basename of the supplied file name.
=item B<out_path(FORCE_EXT)>
Generates an out path based on the file name and the file extension.
If the file name already has an extension, it will not supply one unless FORCE_EXT is true.
=item B<pretty_name()>
Creates a "pretty" CamelCased name.
=item B<vars()>
Generates the output hash ref expected by the templating engine.
